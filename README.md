    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>The Overview of the Application</h2>
    What I plan on doing for my final project is an interactive webpage that will be sort of like a guessing game. 
    I am going to incorporate a game of higher or lower, and the person playing will have 3 guesses to pick a number between 1-52. 
    For each round that they cannot guess the right number, they will be deducted a point, and then when they guess the number they will 
    recieve a point. Once the player is at 3 points, the game is over.

    <h3>Product Name</h3>
    Higher or Lower
    <h4>Team Members:</h4>
    Logan (myself)
    <h5>Technology Overview</h5>
    I will use Visual Studio Code as well as Microsoft Azure.
    <h6>Proposal Last Updated/Feature List/Future Feature List </h6>
    This proposal was last update November 4th, 2022.
    <h7>Feature List</h7>
    - interactive with random number generator.
    - a point system that keeps track of the wins and loses.
    - pictures or gifs to make it appealing to the eye.
    <h8>Future Feature List</h8>
    - If I had more time to work on this application, some of the features that could have been implemented
    would be a whole Blackjack game against the computer. This would incorporate the player who is playing a random card, and then 
    they would have to determine if they want to draw more to try and get as close to 21 as possible, or have a higher hand than the computer.

    <h9>Basic Technical Features</h9>
    In this part I would be including pictures, different font colors, background colors, font sizes, picture sizes, etc. 
    <h10>Advanced Technical Features</h10>
    Some of the advanced technical features that go beyond what we learned in class would be being able to connect the application with another 
    application that would be able to include different games that can go against the computer so it would be like a website filled with interactive games.
